## About me:

Having started my career as a financial analyst, I quickly fell in love with the more "technical" side of things: automating routine and time-consuming tasks with VBA code and Python scripts, working with SQL databases, creating Office extensions with C# and so on. I was growing in the field and became a team leader within FP&A department of a large tech company, but it didn't satisfy my passion for programming. So finally I have decided to pursue my dream career in the field of software development.

I am a keen learner and I feel like my ability and willingness to be constantly gaining new skills and knowledge is something that will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Software Engineer.
